# hi-lo
<sup>*Built with Rust (2024 edition)*</sup>

Simple CLI card game where A is the lowest (1) and King is the highest (13).
An initial card is dealt, and the player guesses if the next card drawn is
higher or lower than the previous. Guess correctly 4 times to win!

To guess higher, enter the letter `h`, or to guess lower, enter the letter `l`.

When the game ends, enter `r` to restart a new game.
